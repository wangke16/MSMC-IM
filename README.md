# MSMC-IM

This is a new method based on MSMC for inferring demographic parameters such as population size, split time, symmetric migration rates and when migration stops, by fitting MSMC results to a Isolation-Migration model. Currently there are two modes of the program: static and dynamic, which estimate either constant population size or time-dependent population size. 
# Guidance
Usage: msmc_im_static.py [-h]

Usage: msmc_im_dynamic.py [-h]
# Installation
The program is written in python3. python 3 is required for running this program.
